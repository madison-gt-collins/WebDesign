What are you most proud of in your final project?
I'm proud of how much variation I added within my final website. I feel like I have learned a lot and I rememebered a lot but I also wanted to add a lot, I have gained interest and passion over the course of this class.
How do you see yourself using these skills in the future?
My final project I made somewhat of a portfolio so I could see myself using it as a portfolio the more I create in any of my future career endevors.
