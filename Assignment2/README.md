Describe any challenges you faced this week. How did you solve them?
    Biggest challneges was getting the main pages boxes all ordered. I like how the quotes are within a box for the overall quotes but I didn't know how to get the footer out of the box! I think also just getting evrything to work. It was A LOT of trial and error. 
What are you most proud of?
    I'm proud of fiduring out how to make fonts different colors and honestly understnding this code enough to add more to the webiste!
How are you doing?
    Overall good! I can't tell if it's taking me a long time to do because it's suppost to or it's harder for me becuase i'm kinda a prefectionist so it's harder for me as I can get frustrated easily. 
What can I do specifically to support you inside and/or outside of class?
    I liked your speicifc feedback on my first assignment and any sort of notes you see within class or common mistakes we make to help us improve. Your information overall is very clear to understand which makes it overall more enjoyable.
