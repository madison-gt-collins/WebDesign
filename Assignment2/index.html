<h3>The First Words of the Book and Some Quotes</h3>
</div>



<div>
    <h4><p>I considered starting with these words: I no longer want to kill you—because I really don’t—but then decided you would think this far too melodramatic. You’ve always hated melodrama, and I don’t want to upset you now, not in the state you’re in, not at what may be the end of your life.</p></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>“I laughed. ‘For a policeman, you’re very romantic.’<br>
    ‘For an artist, you’re very afraid,’ he said.”</p>

    <h4><p>“I laughed. ‘For a policeman, you’re very romantic.’

<div>
    <h4><p>“It's easy to become very focused, I've found, on such small things. Especially when every day is the same”</p></h4>
</div>

<div>
    <h4></p>“Conventions, other people's opinions, the law, all appear laughable in the face of your desire, your drive to reach your love. it's a blissful state. it's fleeting, though, this feeling...”</p></h4>

    <h4></p>“The most impressive thing about him, to me, is his belief in those wings. Useless, fragile, attached to his arms by a couple of cuffs, and yet he believes in them as a child might believe a cloak will make him invisible.”</p></h4>
</div>

<div>
    <h4><p>“I say I do everything possible to avoid thinking about Tom, but, of course, Tom is mostly what I think about. And it is hell. Not least because the more I think about him, the more I cannot remember the reasons why we could not be together. The more I think about him, the less I remember anything that was wrong, or difficult. All I remember is sweetness.”</p></h4>
</div>

<div>
    <h4><p>“He keeps a close eye on his weight, hardly ever takes a drink, swims, walks the dog, and watches documentaries in the evening. Anything involving real-life crime interests him, which always surprises me, considering what happened. And he talks to no one. Least of all to me.”</p></h4>
