<h1>My Policeman</h1>
<h4>A Novel by Bethan Roberts</h4>
<p>I considered starting with these words: I no longer want to kill you—because I really don’t—but then decided you would think this far too melodramatic. You’ve always hated melodrama, and I don’t want to upset you now, not in the state you’re in, not at what may be the end of your life.</p>
